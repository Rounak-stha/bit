# Bit
A JavaScript implementation of Git.
The motivation behind this project is to learn the inner workings of git and understand how the git magic actually happens.

## Run Locally
The goal is to use only the standard libraries and keep the code as vanilla as possible.
However, the project uses ESLint, Prettier, and Chalk for obvious reasons.

```bash
npm i
./bit <OPTIONS>
# EX: ./bit cat-file -p <OBJECT_HASH>
```

## Contribution
The project is in its early steps; feel free to open a PR.

> NOTE: There already exists a mature project [isomorphic-git](https://github.com/isomorphic-git/isomorphic-git) which already has the JS implementation of lots of git features.
